I have found a initial soloution for moving circles around which are connected with lines.
I have found the example code at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19748744/javafx-how-to-connect-two-nodes-by-a-line
After reading through this short code, which is not hard to understand I can now imagine how easy the map can be graphically visualized.

Ideas:

The editing of the TSP knot points (or Objects) will be done in a dedicated interface with a list, textfields and buttons.
This avoids too muc time spending with the visualisation. In the visualisation the points should be visible and movable
There should be dynamic updates while iterating over TSP algorithms. 
The thickness of the lines can be updated and the lines can be made visible or hidden to demonstrate TSP weight impacts.
besides of that the objects can be moved around on the map and the information about the TSP knot points can be saved and restored.

Assignment

We will be given a file and it contains data about

Vertexes and Edges

We need to read in that file that contains a structure of connected Objects. 
The Objects have a Number and the connection has a weight. 

There’s one List containing all Objects,

The weights are not the distance!

Its impossible to walk one route just once! (If you want to solve the grit problem!)
Do not comment simple getters and setters!
